        <h2>Moribyan</h2>
        <p>I stumbled upon Moribyan on Instagram and all her recipes always looked SO good. She's best known for dupes of popular fast 
          foods eg. chipotle, chic fil a etc. She also has lots of her own recipes that are inspired by her own North African Background. Her 
          website is usally the first place I'll visit when I want to find a new recipe to try out. Her recipes are easy to follow and 
          consistently really good. The most recent recipe of hers that I made was her chipotle chicken copy cat. I'll insert the link to that here 
          later. I read her about me page on her blog and she said she started her food blog in college too.

        <h2>FeelGoodFoodie</h2>
        <p>I stumbled upon this account on Instagram too. Yumna is a mom in Michigan who posts her healthy and super easy recipes on Instagram. When I'm 
          looking for a healthy quick recipe I often visit her website. My favorite recipes of hers are the Lebanese ones as they're particularly flavorful. 
          I plan on trying her beef shwarma recipe soon, which I've attached the link to below.

      <div class="chunk3">
        <h2>Pete_Eats</h2>
        <p>Pete_eats is yet another instagram account I stumbled upon that always posts delicious looking recipes. Many of his videos teach you how to make dishes 
          I've never even heard of, but they all look so good. My favorite part of his website is that he has a whole seperate section dedicated to noodle 
          recipes. He also usually includes little tidbits about the cultural background of the dish. Below I've attached a picture and link of a recipe 
          to my favorite thai dish drunken noodles/ pad kee mao.
